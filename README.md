# Agent Based Modelling

A simulation of Schelling's model of segregation between Economists and Psychologists (depicted by individual pixels). 

The MATLAB code will output a video demonstrating the progressive polarisation between groups.

At initialisation, Economists and Psychologists are randomly distributed across the simulated world. Looking like the image below.

Depending on different parameters for tolerance and neighbourhoods between groups, different degrees of polarisation will emerge.
